# Sinatra Basic Forms Lab

Your local pet adoption store has asked you to build their new website. First
and foremost, the store needs a form for their staff to add puppies that are
available for adoption. Good thing you love puppies _and_ coding!

## Objectives

1. Implement a POST request to the controller to display data from a user in
   the view
2. Implement both POST and GET requests
3. Connect a controller action with both a view and a model

## Instructions

The focus of this lab is to build a way for a user to go to a home page,
follow a link to a form where they can enter a puppy's information, and, upon
submission, view the puppy's information.

1. Build out a puppy class in `models/puppy.rb`. Since we are not using
   ActiveRecord in this lab, you will write a bare Ruby model (like you did in
   MOD1). Puppies should have `name`, `breed`, and `age` attributes. You will
   need to be able to pass these three attributes to initialization, as well as
   readers or accessors for the attributes.

2. In `app.rb` build out a GET request to load a home page. The home page
   should go to the main route `/`.

3. The home page will also need a new view `index.erb`. This page should
   welcome you to the Puppy Adoption Site. Add this view to the controller action.

4. Now, we need a form for a user to list a new puppy that is
   available for adoption. You can review this form in `views/create_puppy.erb`.
   Remember, you'll need to set up another controller action for a user to be
   able to view this form in the browser. The "submit" button
   of a form can be an `<input>` element with a `type` of `"submit"` (or a
   `<button>` element with a `type` of `"submit`) — a plain old `<button>`
   won't do it. If you want to change the text in the button, check out these docs:

   - [MDN: Input — submit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit)
   - [MDN: Button](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/button)

5. Now we need to make sure the form is being submitted properly. You'll need to
   have a third controller action that takes the input from the user and renders
   a third view (`views/display_puppy.erb`) which displays the info for the
   puppy that was just created. Create an instance of a puppy to hold the data
   about the puppy you just created.

6. Add a link on the home page to the new puppy form.
